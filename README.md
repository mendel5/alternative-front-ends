## Call to Action
- Do you know any other **free/open-source** projects that are not included in the overview yet? (front ends, alternatives to websites, apps, etc.)
- Just create an issue [here](https://github.com/takomine/Open-source-alternatives/issues) or in the [original repo](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends/issues) and let me know. I'm always looking for new free/open-source projects to add.

## About this repository

**This is a fork of [alternative-front-ends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends). In my opinion, the scope of the original repo has already diverted from just being a catalog of alternative front-ends. This list tries to incorporate not just alternative front-ends but also an alternative open-source application.**

>This overview originally included three alternative front-ends: Invidious (for YouTube), Bibliogram (for Instagram) and Nitter (for Twitter). Therefore it was named `alternative front-ends`. As more projects have been added to the repository, the listed projects partially left the scope of *alternative front-ends*.

>For example, `youtube-dl` is not a front-end, but can be generally described as an open source project that interacts with the internet platform Youtube.

>Therefore the name `alternative front-ends` does not capture the full scope of the listed projects anymore. Maybe this repository will be renamed in the future to better reflect the larger scope. A possible name might be `open-source-alternatives` or something similar.
